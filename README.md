* I prepared this project with a dataset from Kaggle. It was part of the **Big Data and Business Analytics** course I took at **Istanbul Technical University**.

ICFA has compiled this dataset, which contains information on India's rainfall, relative humidity, temperature, and soil composition. We will use this data to develop a system that utilizes the best-growing conditions for specific crops, with the most suitable of the three machine learning models we have created. This system will provide farmers with recommendations for agricultural products based on the data from their land.


N - Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil\
P - Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil\
K - Ratio of Potassium content in soil\
temperature - Temperature in degree Celsius\
humidity - Relative humidity in %\
ph - PH value of the soil\
rainfall - Rainfall in mm
